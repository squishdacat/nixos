## Naming Scheme
As to make every device unique, every device follows the following
config naming scheme.

Firstly, every device should start with a prefix denoting what type
of device it is. This is so that it is easy to know what device is
what 
| Type    | Prefix |
| ------- | ------ |
| Desktop | D |
| Laptop  | L |
| Server  | S |
| Phone   | P |

Afterwards, comes with a random name. This name should be unique (in
the fact that even without the prefix, it is recognisable) and should
not have over 8 chars.
