# coolGi's pkg repo

## Macchina
The version of macchina on the official repos is currently out-of-date, so this updates it.\
This also updates libmacchina to include my [#172](https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/libmacchina/pull/172) and [#173](https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/libmacchina/pull/173) patches to it, fixing some issues on NixOS and including the Nix pkgmgr.
